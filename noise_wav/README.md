## Audio Noise Preparation

This project adopts the audio noise preparation process from the [av_hubert repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/av_hubert/tree/main/avhubert/preparation). Please follow the instructions provided in that repository to set up your audio noise processing environment.

After preparing the noise files, ensure that your `noise_wav` folder contains the following subdirectories:
- `all`
- `babble`
- `music`
- `noise`
